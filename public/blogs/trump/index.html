	<meta name="description" content="As a Master of Financial Analysis student at London Business school, I prefer to enter into the investment banking in the future. Accumulating various internship experiences in the capital markets, I am confident that I would be a good fit for the position based on the following transferrable skills: Analytical and Modelling Skills: During my 4-year undergraduate study, I’ve laid a solid foundation in the field of finance and accounting. Moreover, when I was engaged in the C-round investment project at CITIC Capital, I leveraged my technical skillsets to build the operation models and conducted company valuation using Relative Valuation Method. Communication and Collaboration Skills: As an Investment Banking Intern at CICC, I was staffed on the Due Diligence of 3 different projects. With my excellent teamwork and multi-tasking abilities, I maintained a transparent communication with supervisors and colleagues throughout the whole process, which greatly improved the working efficiency.Research and Quick-learning Skills: Once I was asked to write a report on a certain field, about which I lacked relevant knowledge. Therefore, I firstly collected public information via diversified databases, and actively consulted my alumni and professors, who possessed industry expertise. Ultimately, I delivered the report punctually and got approval.">

<h3>President of the United States</h3>
<p>Donald John Trump is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Born and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump attended Fordham University for two years and received a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He became president of his father’s real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations to building or renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He owned the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice from 2003 to 2015.</p>
