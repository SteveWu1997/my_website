  description = "As a Master of Financial Analysis student at London Business school, I prefer to enter into the investment banking in the future. Accumulating various internship experiences in the capital markets, I am confident that I would be a good fit for the position based on the following transferrable skills: Analytical and Modelling Skills: During my 4-year undergraduate study, Iâ€™ve laid a solid foundation in the field of finance and accounting. Moreover, when I was engaged in the C-round investment project at CITIC Capital, I leveraged my technical skillsets to build the operation models and conducted company valuation using Relative Valuation Method. Communication and Collaboration Skills: As an Investment Banking Intern at CICC, I was staffed on the Due Diligence of 3 different projects. With my excellent teamwork and multi-tasking abilities, I maintained a transparent communication with supervisors and colleagues throughout the whole process, which greatly improved the working efficiency.Research and Quick-learning Skills: Once I was asked to write a report on a certain field, about which I lacked relevant knowledge. Therefore, I firstly collected public information via diversified databases, and actively consulted my alumni and professors, who possessed industry expertise. Ultimately, I delivered the report punctually and got approval."
